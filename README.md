```

and save this to specific folder

```python
from PIL import Image

folder_path= "C:\\Users\\woongsan\\Desktop\\temp_folder"
im = Image.fromarray(rgb_array)
file_name= f"{datetime.datetime.now().timestamp()}.png"
im.save(os.path.join(folder_path,file_name))
```

and done! just copy this folder path to viewer's path textbox
or click 'path' button, and select.

lastly click play'â–¶', and its really done. (click again to stop)

# !!Warning!!
